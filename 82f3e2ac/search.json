    "text": "I am a third year Ph.D. candidate in Cellular and Molecular Medicine and mentored by Cynthia Sears, M.D. at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD. My doctoral work integrates multiple ’omics (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) to determine how the colonic microbiota contribute to chronic disease.\nPreviously, I worked in obesity prevention as a Research Program Coordinator and Interventionst for multilevel, multicomponent obesity prevention trials in Baltimore City, Maryland, and on Native American reservations in the mid- and southwest United States.\nI’m passionate about preventing chronic disease by elucidating the mechanisms by which environmental exposures lead to disease, and promoting a healthy lifestyle through diet and physical activity."
