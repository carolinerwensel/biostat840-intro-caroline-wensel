My doctoral work integrates multiple ’omics (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) to determine how the colonic microbiota contribute to chronic disease.\nPreviously, I worked in obesity prevention as a Research Program Coordinator and Interventionst for multilevel, multicomponent obesity prevention trials in Baltimore City, Maryland, and on Native American reservations in the mid- and southwest United States.\nI’m passionate about preventing chronic disease by elucidating the mechanisms by which environmental exposures lead to disease, and promoting a healthy lifestyle through diet and physical activity."

Wisconsin, Califorina, and New York are the top milk producing states and located in the top milk producing regions: the Lake States, Pacific, and Northeast, respectively. Milk consumption has decreased, while cheese consumption has increased over time. Increased cheese consumption appears to be primarily driven by natural cheeses, especially mozzarella. In the 1970s the an average person consumed less than 3 pounds of mozzarella per year; whereas, in 2017 the average person consumed nearly 12 pounds of mozzarella per year.\nINSERT .BIB FILE\n\n\nFunctions used\n\ndplyr\n\nfilter\nrename\nmutate\ngroup_by\nsummarise\narrange\nslice\n\n\n\ntidyr\n\npivot_longer\n\n\n\nggplot2\n\ngeom_col\ngeom_point\ngeom-smooth\ngeom-boxplot\n\n\n\nstringr\n\nstr_replace_all\nstr_to_sentence"
